This is an awful, no good recreation of Agar.io from scratch. It has exactly two (2) dependencies, ExpressJS and websocket. Everything else is questionably written in vanilla html, css and javascript.

I would never recommend anybody look at this codebase, unless you feel like looking at the feverish code of a high school student trying to write her first proper 2D rendering engine.

# Seriously, don't use this

You can feel free to look around this codebase, and yes I am still proud of whats here, even if it is atrocious, but this really should not be seen as anything more than just an experiment. I largely wanted to get an idea of how one would theoretically implement this without any dependencies. It takes a lot of planning which I did not do, so I hope you enjoy the mess that is my code here.
